### Project 1: Bike-Share Company 
* **Scenario** You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

* **Business Task** Identify how casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently from annual members.

* **Business Goal** Leverage data to design an effective marketing campaign targeting casual riders to increase annual membership.

* **Steps**
  * Cleaned over 5.5 million rows of data
  * Combined monthly data into an annual data set 
  * validated data to ensure the metrics are of same unit and measure the same variables
  * Compare and contrast members and casual riders with respect to bike-type, most used locations, average ride-length, etc.

* **Key Insights**
  * Casual riders peak in the summer making up 8.1% of total annual ridership in the month of July alone.
  * Casual riders hit their lowest numbers in the winter, with 0.2% of annual ridership in February.
  * 15% of casual riders use docked bikes in comparison to 0% of members.

* **Reccomendations** 
  * Build a marketing campaign advertising member-exclusive deals on docked bikes while highlighting their uses and availability.
  * Ads should be placed primarily in stations where most docked bikes and casual rides start and end at, this information is highlighted in an interactive             vizualization.
